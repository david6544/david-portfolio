The following is what I've learnt about leadership, through experience, observation and education. First, lets define what (I think at least) a good leader is:
#### A Good Leader:
A good leader is one that inspires the loyalty and dedication of team in order to achieve bigger things than what they could do alone. A good leader becomes the oil with which an engine can run, and dictates how smooth everything functions. A good leader is responsible for the success of their team, accountable for their shortcomings, honest about decisions, and aware of the nature of every team member. A good leader has a vision, and strives to achieve this vision by making decisions for the collective good. A good leader is practical, honest, good natured and gets the best from his team.

Of the best and worst leaders i've had the pleasure (or displeasure) of witnessing, I believe that a number of traits stick out among all others. These are: Responsibility, Accountability, Awareness, and Decisiveness. I believe that these four qualities can distinguish the best from the worst. I'll outline each of these mean to me, pass along some general pieces of wisdom I've heard...

#### Responsibility:
This quality is hard to define or maybe I just lack the literacy... To me it means understanding that you drive the boat.  The direction, speed, comfort of the ride and attitude of the crew, is entirely up to you. Not necessarily how oiled the motor is, or how clean the planks are, but the big picture is in your control. It's about understanding that you now have a duty to something greater than yourself.

It's important to understand that every single decision you make as a leader will have an impact, both on the situation at hand, and the way in which all your team-members approach future activities. In this way, be aware that when you make a decision, especially those which some may not agree with, you do so because of a clear, well defined reason. To be responsible as a leader is to make sure that these reasons are for the collective good, and not for personal gain.

#### Accountability:
To be accountable is often times different from a leadership position. As a leader, you are accountable for the failure of your entire team, if something goes awry, something doesn't get planned, something turns out wrong, you are accountable for this. The image of your team is on your shoulders and as long as you are the leader, saying "oh that was bob not me", doesn't cut it. Often times as a leader, you don't get praised for the work that you do, and that's part of the process, it's not your job to take credit, it's your job to make the operation run smoothly, and that means congratulating and giving credit where it is due. I believe this is why many people aren't successful in leadership positions, they don't get their roses, and blame it on others, it's often times a thankless job where no-one person understands everything that you have to manage.

#### Awareness:
As a leader, it's critical to be aware of how your team is doing and what everyone is up to. Now make sure you understand, this does **NOT** mean you make decisions **for** people, it means that you're aware of what they're working on. This can be as simple as reading through descriptions of documents, emails, or just setting up a 10 minute call to catch up every week. Being aware of everyone's movements is the key trait of a good general, how can one properly direct troops or figure out what needs to be done if you don't even know where and what your people are doing? 

Not only must you be aware of what your people are doing, you must be aware of **who they are**. This means, their preferred style of work, their communication style, the way the take constructive feedback, the way in which they're best praised. You need to know their habits they have in the system that you run, their commitment level, their avaliability and more. Without this knowledge how would you know who best to ask to do something that needs to be done?

#### Decisiveness:
Being a leader can be boiled down to just decision making, that's all it is, its just decision-making that affects other people. The previous sections have all talked about making the most reasoned, systematic, informed decisions, and these are all important prerequisites, however they are useless, without the ability to **make a decision**. The ability to say, "this is where we are going", "this is the vision I have", and in support of that vision, "we will do this". 

Understanding first, the responsibility you have to your team, second the accountability you must take in potential failure, and third the awareness you must maintain across your team, is all underpinned by the foundational ability to make a concrete decision. This means analysing the situation from all those fronts and picking the best course of action, understanding that the decision is not a reflection of you, and not being afraid to revise it, change it or completely throw it out if necessary. To make effective decisions you have to have the humility to say you were wrong, figuring out why, and learning from those reasons to get better. All feedback, good or bad, should teach you something about yourself.

I think that understanding these traits will help you define what it takes to lead people, among those traits, there are a few concepts which I think are quite important.

#### Officers eat last:
This is a concept from the US marines, where the highest officer makes sure that everyone eats before them, juniors first. This embodies how you should treat every single member of your team, from the bottom up, the goal is to show respect and loyalty to every single one of your team members. Understand who they are, what they need to be successful, and provide that to the best of your ability. Understand what tools they need, what environments they thrive in, such that they are able to produce their best work, and by working incredibly hard to provide that, they will reward you by doing their best work. This attitude of putting yourself last, is an incredibly important trait to have as a leader and is foundational to having a team that is incredibly dedicated, loyal and hard-working.

#### Empower your people:
This isn't really a concept, it's just incredibly vital to make sure that your team feels like they are in control. This means that you need to empower them to make decisions, quickly, effectively and that have impact on the work that they do. As a good leader you need to create an environment where people feel like they **want** to do more work, they want to contribute to something and that they feel rewarded when doing so. This is especially vital when dealing with volunteers, as there's no monetary compensation to help you with this, keeping people aware, alert, and happy to continue doing things is critical to making sure goals can be met.

#### Rain falls downward:
The weather on the ground comes from the sky, just as the attitude that's fostered in your team comes straight from the top. This is a concept which is necessary for a good leader to understand, as they create the environment in which their team works in. Things like being hostile towards people, punishing in public, and dismissing effort creates a hostile environment that no-one wants to work in The opposite is true as well, rewarding people, showcasing incredible work, and having a consistently positive attitude will do wonders. As a leader you are the weather, you dictate the setting and mood of day-to-day interactions and making sure you're aware of that is important for fostering an environment that people want to work in.

#### Lead from the front:
This concept, also from the military, is a good distinction between leadership and management. Leaders lead, managers manage. It's hard to describe, but a leader makes decisions where they hold responsibility for failure, and give credit to their team upon success. Managers tell others what to do, take credit for the team's success and don't take accountability for failure, blaming it on the person executing the task. A good leader shouldn't hesitate to execute any task that their team is responsible for, and picks up the slack for anyone when necessary. Leaders solve problems for their team to achieve the goal, managers use their team to solve their own problems.

#### The reason leadership is hard:
Leadership is conceptually quite simple, but executing it with consistency and selflessness is hard. I think most people are fine with responsibility, until something goes wrong and they have to take accountability for something major. Creating processes and environments which breed failure and contempt is just as bad if not worse than failing to execute a task yourself. 

Awareness is another common thing that leaders struggle with, its an incredible juggling game to be aware of everyone, it requires a fair amount of organisational skill to understand who people are and how they operate as well as their current status. Executing it properly requires coordination and great management skills as its easy to get caught up in the details of someones work instead of getting the big picture. Especially if your team is large, it can be very time-consuming to keep track of everyones movements.

Decision making is often times not a big weakness for leaders, however it can be. Being quick to make a decision and making the right decision is often where the failure can lie. Understanding the difference between real and simulated pressure, is a good skill for a leader to have. It's easy to get caught up in situations that don't need to be acted on right away, and you can go away and think about it for a second. The opposite is also true, it's easy to think that you can always delay a decision and act on it later when in reality it'd be most beneficial for you to make this decision now. Drawing a balance between these two points is hard to do, and comes largely through trial and error, making decisions and observing the outcomes closely.

Leadership is hard because everyone on your team is only aware of their role, and your interaction with them, meaning that without an outside audit no-one really knows just how much work a leader has to do to keep everything together. It's mostly thankless and that can be quite frustrating after lots of time and effort spent planning or dealing with issues.

#### How you can be a better leader:

**Have a vision:**
I've found, that the best leaders have a vision they know what they want to see from the team. The ability to communicate this vision and have their team share in it, is a key skill in what makes their people "buy in" and give it their all. Try to think of the best leaders you know of, and you might immediately picture their vision for themselves and their people alongside them.

**Be aware of who your team is**:
Understand who the people on your team are, become friends with them, know what their habits are, what their partners names are, what they like to do, catch up with them and figure out what makes them tick. What do they love, what do they hate? How can you make them more effective. If your team are weapons in an armoury, a good leader knows how to sharpen them.

**Keep a positive attitude**:
Understand that as a leader, your attitude is infectious, and you spread everything across the team, fear, hostility, happiness, hope, whatever it may be. If you are seen with your team, you need to figure out what it is that you express because it'll be picked up before you know it.

**Be Self Aware**:
Understand the way you tick before you start analysing others, figure out what it is that annoys you, what your habits are. Understand which decisions you make out of emotion or logic, what it is that makes you pleased and happy, what your organisational skills are like. Without understanding yourself to a high degree it will be difficult to understand the way others operate. Being able to understand yourself will give you significant leverage when making decisions.

**Ask don't tell**:
This is a common trap I see people fall into, if you ask someone to do something, they're much more likely to do it, than if you tell them directly. "Hey could you do this for me" versus "Go do this". It's a simple switch, but people go to very long lengths to help other people, and if you foster the correct environment then this should be a no-brainer.
